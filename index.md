# Hello My web site

This is the implementation for
[the post on stateless HTML](http://www.colorglare.com/2014/11/24/stateless-html.html).


This site is hosted by GitHub, so there is no server logic, only static HTML
pages. When using the main navigation, it loads the page with AJAX, and replaces
the content dynamically.

This page is a proof of concept and only works on modern browsers (IE9+, and
standard Firefox, Chrome and Opera). It would be easy to adapt the code to
work in older browser versions, but I wanted to keep the source code as simple
as possible.
